   I'm a full-stack machine learning engineer who likes solving real-world problems. Previously, I've worked at Modal, a serverless compute platform free of config files, Edlight, PBC, a startup building easy-to-use solutions for teachers, and Procurement Sciences, a startup building proposal writing tools for government contractors.
